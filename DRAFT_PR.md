# Draft PR: Add OmniLadle.spoon â€“ Omnispindle MCP Client Spoon

## Summary

This PR adds **OmniLadle.spoon**, a mystical Hammerspoon Spoon for connecting to an Omnispindle MCP (Model Context Protocol) server, providing real-time and HTTP-based project management integration for Hammerspoon users.

## Features

- Real-time project updates via SSE (Server-Sent Events)
- Fallback HTTP mode for legacy/compatibility
- Automatic connection management and error recovery
- Rich, themed logging (with override support)
- Secrets/configuration via `hs.settings` or `.secrets` file
- Project list API compatible with FileManager

## Installation & Configuration

cd ~/.hammerspoon/Spoons
git clone https://github.com/madness-interactive/OmniLadle.spoon.git
cp ~/.hammerspoon/Spoons/OmniLadle.spoon/.secrets.example ~/.hammerspoon/.secrets
# Edit ~/.hammerspoon/.secrets as needed
```

## Usage Example
